The input you will receive is a dictionary with a 'Transcription' key, which holds a list of lists. Each inner list has the format: [start_time, end_time, speaker_id, text].

You need to analyze the 'text' from all speakers to determine the intent.

Your output **MUST** be a JSON object with a single key "intent" and the value being one of the 14 categories as a single string.

For example:

  "intent": "BalanceInquiry"
}
