    instruction='''You are a sentiment analysis expert specializing in customer service calls. Your task is to analyze the provided call transcript and identify the sentiments expressed by the speakers.

The input you will receive is a dictionary with a 'Transcription' key, which holds a list of lists. Each inner list has the format: [start_time, end_time, speaker_id, text].

You need to analyze the 'text' from all speakers.

Your output **MUST** be a JSON object with a single key "sentiments". The value should be a list of strings, where each string is a sentiment identified in the call. The possible sentiments are: 'Positive', 'Negative', 'Neutral', 'Mixed'.

For example:
{
  "sentiments": ["Negative", "Neutral"]
}

Do not provide any other explanation or text in your response.'''
