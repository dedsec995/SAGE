# Investigation of "App name mismatch detected" Warning

## 1. The Problem

The application console displays the following warning:

`App name mismatch detected. The runner is configured with app name "Bank Audio Transcript Analyst", but the root agent was loaded from "/home/dedsec995/assignment/SAGE/env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/google/adk/agents", which implies app name "agents".`

This warning originates from the Google ADK library.

## 2. Analysis

I investigated the codebase to determine the source of this warning.

*   I confirmed that the `APP_NAME` is consistently defined as "Bank Audio Transcript Analyst" in both `app.py` (the Streamlit frontend) and `sage/main.py` (the command-line interface).
*   This `APP_NAME` is used when initializing the `Runner` and when creating, listing, and retrieving sessions using the `DatabaseSessionService`.
*   The agent definitions, including the main `manager_agent` in `sage/manager_agent/agent.py`, do not contain any explicit `app_name` configuration.
*   The warning message indicates that the `google-adk` library is inferring an `app_name` of "agents" based on the file path from which the agent is loaded. This is happening because the agent code is located within the Python environment's `site-packages` directory, specifically under a `google/adk` path.

## 3. Conclusion

The warning is a result of how the Google ADK library resolves the application name when an agent is loaded from a path that it interprets as being generic. It does not appear to have any functional impact on the SAGE application, as confirmed by the note in the `GEMINI.md` file.

Since the application is working as expected, and the warning is internal to the ADK, no code changes are required at this time. This document serves to record the investigation and its conclusion.
